### Precursor

The following Code of Conduct is inspired by various sources. They're listed below:

- The Golang Community's Code of Conduct, at <https://golang.org/conduct>.
- The IETF's Netiquette Guidelines under RFC1885, at <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855>. 
- Vuze's Rules for IRC, at <https://wiki.vuze.com/w/Rules_for_IRC#Rules_for_IRC>.

### About

Online communities include people from many different backgrounds. The moderator
team here is committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment
for everyone, regardless of age, disability, gender, or similar personal
characteristics. 

The first goal of this Code of Conduct is to specify a standard behavior so that
people with different communication styles can talk effectively, productively,
and respectfully.

The second goal is to provide mechanisms and guidelines for conflicts in the
community when they arise.

The final goal is to make the community a welcoming place for people. For a
community to be successful, it needs lots of people contributing to
conversations, so others could join in and contribute more.

With that said, a healthy community must allow for disagreement and debate. The
Code of Conduct is not a mechanism for people to silence others with whom they
disagree.

### Do

- Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you receive. You should
  not send heated messages (we call these "flames") even if you are provoked.
  On the other hand, you shouldn't be surprised if you get flamed and it's
  prudent not to respond to flames. Productive communication requires effort.
- Be specific and don't bother others, including pinging (unless given). In
  general, most people who use the Internet don't have the time to answer
  general questions. Be patient when you ask for help, we're not a tech support
  company.
- Remember that the people here are human beings whose culture, language, and
  humor have different points of reference from your own. Be especially careful
  with sarcasm. Not everyone is using their native language, so meaning and tone
  can be lost in translation.
- Use emojis or smileys to indicate tone of voice, but use them sparingly.
  Don't assume that the inclusion of a smiley will make the recipient happy with
  what you say or wipe out an otherwise insulting comment.
- Interpret arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree. When we
  do disagree, try to understand why. Avoid non-constructive criticism, don't
  merely attack the state of affair, offer (or at least solicit) suggestions as
  to how things could be improved.
- Stay on topic with the channel. It's important that we keep conversations
  sorted out to make it easier for others to join in. Other off-topic
  conversations could go to #home or #devnull.
- Keep up to date with this Code of Conduct. It may be amended from time to
  time, and it will be your responsibility to be aware of these changes.

### Don't

- Name call, throw insulting remarks or belittle other people's personal
  features.
	- Personal features include nationality, race, creed, color, ethnicity,
	  religion, age, gender, politics, ideas, knowledge, opinions, size, shape,
	  hobbies, pets, sexual orientation, or any other.

- Insult anyone. As stated above, you may disagree with anything or anyone you
  like, but you may not insult them. This also means nobody may insult you
  either.

- Harassment, threats, vulgarity, obscenity, sexual or anatomical references,
  accusations, flaming, bickering, and flooding are also forbidden. 
	- Flaming is defined as saying anything directly offensive and hurtful to
	  other individuals. This includes the things listed above, as well as the
	  intention to discredit, harm, put down, ostracize, or stirring up others
	  to do similar.
	- Bickering is defined as arguing over petty and trivial matters.
	- Flooding is defined as posting many identical or meaningless messages in
	  any way that results in an unreasonable amount of space taken.
- Discuss potentially offensive or sensitive issues. This all too often leads to
  unnecessary conflict. There are some exceptions to this, but they ought to go
  to #devnull.
- Advertise. This includes server invitation links. The only exceptions are
  links that relate to the topic of the server (including blogs, websites, Git
  repositories, etc).

#### Don't, but for technical bits

- Use names with no characters. Names with no characters are obnoxious and hard
  to tag. Names with characters that can be inputted on the keyboard are
  preferred.

### Our Responsibilities

- The moderator team is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
  behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
  response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
- The moderator team has the right and responsibility to remove messages,
  images, videos, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of
  Conduct, or to kick or ban (temporarily or permanently) any contributor for
  behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
- The moderator team is dedicated to providing an environment where participants
  feel welcome and safe.

### Keep in mind

- People are complicated, you should expect to be misunderstood and to
  misunderstand others. When this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be
  defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was
  intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to
  provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of all parties to
  de-escalate conflict when it arises.
- Rules may not be enforced all the time, 24/7, and will heavily depend on the
  severity and attitude of the people. That said, there's always a limit: if you
  feel like someone else have gone past it, please contact the moderator team.
- Some exceptions to the rules can be made in #devnull, however, the channel has
  its limits as well. It's not a place for breaking the rules.
- If you see someone violating the Code of Conduct, you are encouraged to
  address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved
  quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of
  their dispute. 
- #showcase-only and #feedback are only for serious content. #showcase-only has
  to be a project or a screenshot. #feedback has to be a detailed and
  constructive feedback. Any discussions about #feedback have to go in #meta.

### Summary (TL;DR)


- Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
- Be thoughtful in how you communicate.
- Don’t be destructive or inflammatory.
- If you encounter an issue, please contact the moderation team.
