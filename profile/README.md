# nixhub

Welcome to nixhub! We're a community growing from a Discord community of the
same name. Most of the discussions circulate around not just Linux/Unix but also
various other relevant topics like programming, because that's fun, too.

While the community tries to facilitate such discussions, server members often
(and are more than welcome to) also discuss about various different topics like
gaming and life.

Most channels within the community are bridged across Discord and Matrix, and we
have members who actively talk in both places!

## Resources

The official Discord invitation link is
[discord.gg/kF9mYBV](https://discord.gg/kF9mYBV). Members of this Discord can
find this link at any time in the #code-of-conduct channel.

The official Matrix space link is
[#nixhub-spaces:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#nixhub-spaces:matrix.org).
Similarly, members of this Matrix space can obtain the invite link anytime
there.

The server's rules are written in the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nixhub-io/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
There is a Summary section, and while you shouldn't have to read the Code of
Conduct if you're friendly, we take the Code of Conduct seriously when things
are escalated and assume that every member has already (at least briefly) read
it, so we strongly encourage you to do so.
